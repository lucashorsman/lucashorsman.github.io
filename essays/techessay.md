In the world of software engineering, my interests lie in the simple joy of coding. I'm all about writing scripts and building video games â€“ a project that's still a work in progress but keeps me engaged and excited. The idea of eventually publishing my game is a cool goal, a bit daunting, but it's a journey of learning and creativity.

I also find satisfaction in the marriage of code and music. Using algorithms to generate playlists is my way of blending my love for tunes with my coding knack. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a fun exploration of how code can enhance everyday experiences.

Back in high school, I got into robotics. Programming robots turned out to be pretty neat, especially when you see lines of code translating into real-world actions. It's not as fancy as it sounds, but it's a practical side of coding that fascinates me.

Looking forward, I just want to keep things real. Finishing and publishing my game is a priority, and I hope to make it more user-friendly. I'll keep toying with music-related code because, well, it's enjoyable. And when it comes to robotics, I'm eager to dive deeper into making code work seamlessly in the physical world. My journey in software engineering is a mix of curiosity, hands-on experience, and the drive to keep learning in a down-to-earth way.
