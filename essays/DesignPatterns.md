# Lets Build A House
To build a house we must do a lot of preparation before any cement is laid. To even start, we must decide the look of the house, decide on what materials to use, draw up blueprints, plan electrical and plumbing amnenities, and consider enviromental factors. Once all of this is done, then ground can be broken (if you want to build the house safely that is. The fool would start by throwing up walls willy-nilly without the above considerations). This sounds like a lot of work! 

# What about all these other houses?  
People have been building houses for a while, surely there are professionals out there we can ask for good practices or have some some old, effective blueprints we can reuse. This is where the idea of a design pattern comes in. In the case of these houses, we can use the design patterns (i.e good blueprints, electrical and plumbing systems etc.) to make building the house much faster and easier for us newbie construction workers. This is basically what a design pattern is. The idea is to leverage an old concept to solve a similar problem rather than 'reinvent the wheel' and design a whole new (and probably ineffecient) solution. Design patterns help to bring newcomers up to the standard that professionals work at. 

# Suprise! It's a programming essay!
The idea of a design pattern is essential to the work of any object oriented programmer. In web development there are numerous design patterns to learn about. These typically come in the form of pseudo-documentation style sites (ala [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/#patterns)) or books like "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by GoF. In these resources we can find a lot of patterns to solve common problems that have known solutions. Once we can understand a pattern, implementation is just one more step in the process, and not a incredibly complex one. Implementation is just following the blueprint, so to speak.
