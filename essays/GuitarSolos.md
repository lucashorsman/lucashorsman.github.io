Built to Spill, Radiohead, Pavement and Jack White are all well known for thier innovative guitar sound. Here I just want to collect and talk about some of my favorite bits from these artist's discography. 

Built to Spill has these awesome solos, where the guitar will run ahead and slow back down with the tempo of the drums. This is apparent In Carry The Zero. Which now that I am listening, as I write, I notice the huge similarity to a Smashing Pumpkins solo. The guitar doesnt really go crazy like in a Tom Morello track, but instead steadily builds alongside the drum and backing. The solo on this track comes back to close out the ending too, I really like that touch. There is something really hypnotic about Built to Spill's guitar work. On Time Trap, I feel so drawn into the melody, and its largely due to how the guitar has this lulling quality to it. I really like how it makes me feel. The song Distopian Dream Girl nails this super long fade out solo which I love.
