# Introduction
HTML and CSS are some of the most important tools to web development. They underlie the majority of websites, and most web developers have a familiarity with them. Something that some developers do, instead of relying on pure HTML/CSS for stylization, is to use a UI Framework, like Bootstrap 5 or Semantic UI. These frameworks have built in CSS classes that allow many unique possibilities. The most important of these include, in my opinion, the pre-built items such as ‘navbars’ and the layout utilities like “row” and “col”. 
# My Experiences
I have built only a few pages relying on Bootstrap 5, so I am not very familiar with all of the components included in the framework, but I can immediately see just how important utilization of these tools can be. Although it takes some fiddling with the classes and such, Bootstrap is a great help and massively reduces the time it takes to build a competent webpage. At this point I can pretty quickly construct a copy of a webpage with very little knowledge of the original website aside from a picture. This is basically what my software engineering course’s ‘Workout Of The Day's have been since we have started studying UI Frameworks. For example, I created a copy of [Island Snow’s](https://islandsnow.com/) web page using Bootstrap 5. Just note that their current website design is actually really cool now, I based my version off of an older version of their page.

# Island Snow
For ‘Island Snow’ I realized that the very top of the page could be a navbar, with Bootstrap 5 icons. Then right below is the logo which is just an image, then another navbar to navigate around the website, then the main image, then a footer. I decided to implement this from top to bottom using a ‘row’ structure, where each of the components are on different rows. Interestingly, for the second navbar, I chose to use the ‘col’ structure to divide the different navigation links. It was pretty tricky to get all the divs sorted out correctly, but the finished product looks great.

# Conclusion
This was a fun project to learn how Bootstrap 5 works. It was a huge eye-opener to how web pages actually get built. Parts of the process are now demystified, which is really exciting for me as a blossoming web developer. I would say UI Frameworks like Bootstrap 5 are incredibly useful for web development and I think learning how to use them is a worthwhile experience. Mostly for the reduced time for implementing similar yet different components. I will say that these frameworks do have a slight downside in this way though. I feel that they may contribute to an overall homogenized look to the Web. The Web can be an awesome place to express unique ideas, but I think if everyone’s website looks similar due to relying on these frameworks, then we risk a boring Web.
