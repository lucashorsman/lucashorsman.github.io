This script automates the creation of a Spotify playlist by extracting songs from a Spinitron show. Users can provide a Spinitron show URL (e.g., [https://spinitron.com/KTUH/pl/18030348/In-The-Garage](https://spinitron.com/KTUH/pl/18030348/In-The-Garage)), and the script will gather all the songs from that show and generate a corresponding playlist in their Spotify account.
